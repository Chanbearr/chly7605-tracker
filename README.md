## Development Process
### Iterations
Initially, I only included a form page and list of submitted content. Along the way, I eventually developed the emoji modal worked with the web page.
### Version Control
### Git
Throughout this project, Git was utilised to manage my source code and track the progression of the web page development. The project was version-controlled by Git which tracked any changes to the code. 

Cloning the repository created a local copy of a remote repository, allowing changes on the code.
### Testing 
During the the development process of this web page, validation tools were used for the HTML and CSS code. The following tools were used to test this.
- HTML Validator: HTML code was validated using W3C Markup Validation Service.
- CSS Validator: CSS code was validated using W3C CSS Validation Servive. 
Both these tools helps to identify any syntax errors or warnings in your code.

To validate the your code, you can follow these steps:

## Lessons Learnt
The importance of seperating different functionalities in the code, which prepares a more cohesive and well developed code. Through the utilisation of html, css, and javascript, it helped develop a further understanding on how front-end and back-end flow together to create a website.

Understanding and learning about event handling and form submissions with button clicks, modal pop up. This shows the importance of interactive elements in a web page.

Learning about responsive designs that need to be considered for creating a web page that enhances user experience with different elements such as changes for different window sizes.
## Recommendations for Future Improvement
Edit funtionality: A function that can allow users to modify the submitted content could be included to allow them to freely edit if they made a mistake.

Filteration: Allowing users to filter the songs either alphabetically or by genre would be a useful tool to provide a more smooth user experience.
